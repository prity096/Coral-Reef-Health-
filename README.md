# Coral-Reef-Health-Assesment
 Image Processing 
 
 Coral reefs face critical threats from climate change
 requiring scalable monitoring solutions. We developed an auto
 mated coral health classification system using deep learning ar
 chitectures including ResNet18, EfficientNetV2-B2, and TResNet
 Mtrained on underwater coral imagery. Four models were evaluated 
 to classify coral health into six categories: healthy, compro
 mised, dead, rubble, physical issues, and disease. EfficientNetV2-B2 
 achieved the highest accuracy of 80.68% on the test set.
 Weighted loss functions improved detection of minority health
 classes despite minimal impact on overall performance. This
 approach demonstrates the feasibility of automated coral health
 assessment for large-scale reef monitoring applications.
